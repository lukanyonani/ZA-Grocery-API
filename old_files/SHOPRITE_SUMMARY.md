## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Works:
- **Regular `requests` library** - No JavaScript rendering needed!
- **BeautifulSoup parsing** - Server-side rendered HTML
- Products are already in the initial HTML (unlike PnP)
- Fast scraping (~2 seconds)

### What Doesn't Work:
- **Selenium/Headless browsers** - Blocked by Shoprite's anti-bot system
- Returns error page when using automated browsers

## 🚫 Anti-Bot Protection

Shoprite detects and blocks:
- Selenium WebDriver
- Headless browsers
- Automated tools

But allows:
- Regular HTTP requests (requests library)
- Normal user-agents

## 💡 How Prices Work

Shoprite displays prices based on a default store (Shoprite Govan Mbeki Str in this case).
The scraper successfully extracts:
- Regular prices from `js-item-product-price` div
- Special prices from `special-price__price` div  
- Original prices (before special) when available
- All products show their current special offers

## 📁 Output Files

- `shoprite_products.json` - JSON format
- `shoprite_products.csv` - CSV format

## 🆚 Comparison: PnP vs Shoprite

| Feature | Pick n Pay | Shoprite |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Framework** | Angular SPA | React SSR |
| **Initial HTML** | Empty (~38KB) | Full (~1.1MB) |
| **Products in HTML** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Needs JavaScript** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Scraping Method** | Selenium + Network monitoring | Requests + BeautifulSoup |
| **Speed** | ~30 seconds | ~2 seconds |
| **Blocks Selenium** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Prices Available** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Products per page** | ~100+ | 20 |

## 📝 Usage

```bash
# Run the scraper
/home/luke/StudioProjects/Python/.venv/bin/python shoprite_scraper.py
```

## 🎯 Limitations

1. **Only 20 products per page** - Need pagination for more (3,578 total available)
2. **Can't use Selenium** - Anti-bot protection blocks automated browsers
3. **Default store pricing** - Shows prices from default store (Shoprite Govan Mbeki Str)

## 🔄 Pagination

To scrape multiple pages:
```python
scraper = ShopriteScraper()

for page in range(3):
    url = f"https://www.shoprite.co.za/c-2413/All-Departments/Food?page={page}"
    scraper.scrape(url=url)
```

## ✨ Advantages over PnP

1. **Much faster** - No browser automation needed
2. **Simpler code** - Just requests + BeautifulSoup
3. **Less resource intensive** - No Chrome process
4. **More reliable** - No JavaScript rendering issues

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

1. **Blocks automation** tools (Selenium)
2. **Fewer products** per page (20 vs 100+)
3. **Need pagination** for full 3,578 products

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Add pagination** - Scrape all 3,578 products across multiple pages
2. **Store selection** - Allow choosing different stores for pricing
3. **Category filtering** - Scrape specific categories
4. **Price tracking** - Monitor price changes over time

## 📊 Data Quality

- **Product names**: 100% ✅
- **Product URLs**: 100% ✅  
- **Images**: 100% ✅
- **Stock status**: 100% ✅
- **Prices**: 100% ✅
- **Special indicators**: 100% ✅
- **Product codes**: 0% ❌ (not in accessible HTML)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **SSR is scraper-friendly** - Much easier than SPAs
2. **Anti-bot detection** - Blocks Selenium but not requests
3. **Store-based pricing** - Common in South African retail
4. **Not all content is equal** - HTML presence ≠ data availability
